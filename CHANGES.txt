- feature complete with initial distribution

- added manage interface

- added search page

- added pruning as part of scan command to remove records from the
  index that no longer exist on the filesystem or are no longer being
  managed by spazzer.

- added some caching logic to scanning to speed things up a little

- added a simple flash mp3 player to provide in browser playback

- switched from package based running to instance based running via
  paste and paste templates, this makes the documentation a bit easier
  to understand and use if you are not a python developer. Also has
  the nice side effect of not blowing away your database when you
  re-install. i hope to find an easier way to install things in the
  future.
